# AMALGM

2019-10-25:
The Ab initio Mean-field Augmented Lattice Gas Modeling (AMALGM) Code is currently in beta development. It is currently available as a set of MATLAB scripts with minimal support, but is otherwise a functioning program. 

As time progresses, AMALGM will be recoded in C++ and expanded to include automated structure generation and other features needed to make the program self-contained and maximally useful to the user. Please stay tuned for these developments.
